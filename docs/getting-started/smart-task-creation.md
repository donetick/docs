# Smart Task Creation

Create tasks naturally using simple sentences that Donetick automatically parses.

## Quick Examples

```
Take out trash tomorrow P1
Water plants every Monday 
Buy groceries next Friday at 5pm
```

## Smart Parsing Features

### Priority Levels
- **P1** or **Urgent** - Highest priority
- **P2**, **P3**, **P4** - Lower priorities
- **Important**, **ASAP** - Also recognized as P1

### Due Dates
Donetick understands natural language dates:
- `tomorrow`, `next week`, `Monday`
- `August 1st at 12pm`
- `in 3 days`, `next month`

### Frequency Patterns
Set recurring tasks automatically:
- `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `yearly`
- `every Tuesday and Thursday`
- `every 2 weeks`

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific**: "Clean kitchen tomorrow P2" is better than "clean"
2. **Use natural language**: Type as you would speak
3. **Combine features**: Mix priority, dates, and frequency in one sentence

The smart parser highlights recognized elements in different colors as you type, so you can see what it understands.
